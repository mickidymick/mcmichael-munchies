                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Measure out the bread flour, all purpose flour, and salt and add them all to a bowl. Thouroughly mix them together and add them to the water and starter mixture.</p>
                        <img src="https://mcmichael-munchies.com/images/sourdough-dough.jpg" alt="dough bowl" />
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Cover the bowl with a kitchen towel and let the dough rest for 30 minutes.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>After the 30 minute rest period, give your dough its first set of stretch and folds. Recover the bowl and set asside for another 30 minutes.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>After the 30 minute rest period, give your dough its second set of stretch and folds. Recover the bowl and set asside for another 30 minutes.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>After the 30 minute rest period, give your dough its third and final set of stretch and folds.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Now that the stretch and folds or finished cover the dough back up and let it rest for the rest of the bulk fermentation process. This should take between 3.5 - 5 more hours.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>After the bulk ferment its time to do the preshape. Take out the dough and place it smooth side up.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Sprinkle some flour on the dough and gently shape it into a ball with your hands or a bench scraper. Then cover the dough and let rest for another 30 minutes.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Now shape the dough into the whatever shape banneton you have. I preffer an oval-shaped loaf.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>To shape a batard, or oval-shaped loaf, start by sprinkling some flour on the countertop and place top or smooth side of your dough down.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Press the dough down gently and stretch into a rectangle. Flip the right third of the dough over the middle section and then the left third over that section.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Flip the dough long ways pointing away from you and slowly tuck and roll the dough away from you until it is rolled up.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Grab the edges of the spiral on the top side and pull them down covering the spiral. This just makes it look a bit prettier.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Add some flour to your banneton and place your dough in it seam side up. Place in the fridge for at least 6 hours but I generaly do so for about 10 - 12.</p>
                    </li>
